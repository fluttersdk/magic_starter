// The agent-facing reference for this package lives in ANOTHER repository.
//
// `.pubignore` excludes `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/`, so an agent adopting this
// package from pub.dev never sees them. What it lands on is
// `magic/skills/magic-framework/references/plugin-starter.md`, which is
// versioned by `magic`'s releases rather than by this package's, and therefore
// drifts silently. Measured once: the reference was stamped alpha.23 against a
// shipped alpha.27 and still documented the notification UI that had moved out
// of this package entirely.
//
// This test is the cheapest gate that exists for a cross-repository document.
// It cannot run in CI, which clones no siblings, so it SKIPS there rather than
// failing. Releases are cut locally, which is where it fires, and
// `.claude/commands/release.md` carries the same requirement in prose for the
// case where somebody runs the suite somewhere else entirely.
